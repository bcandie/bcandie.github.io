        <p>Rosie started from humble beginnings, at a shelter where she was the only dog small enough to fit into the ridiculously tiny apartment I lived in. When I got her she was only <strong>4 years old</strong>, which is actually like a third of her life, but to me she was a baby. On <b>October 14th</b> I took Rosie home with me in my backpack for the low, low cost of 200$. You can see the first ever photo of her here, thanks to the shelter. <u>she is so beautiful....</u></p>
        
        <p>Rosie was my first real dog as an adult. I had my own as a teen, <b>his name was Cola</b>, but that's a story for another time, this page is about Rosie. She lived with me through three apartments and <strong>4 years</strong>. I loved her endlessly and I miss her everyday, she was and will always be my baby, I'm joking around a lot but she was a very special, particularly tempermental dog, and she was mine.</p>

        <p>I could try and seriously describe Rosie's personality, but she is such an unserious and grumpy dog. So let's keep it light with a quick synopsis and a fun chart below. Rosie was a dog who picked and chose when she had the tempermant of a <u>puppy</u> or a <b>geriatric old man</b>. She was simultaneously anxious and unbothered. She liked meeting new people until she didn't and she loved ripping the squeaky out of her toys. She's like if a mean girl was a dog with the memory of what it was like to be human and also 68yrs old.</p>
