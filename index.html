        <h2>What's up, dog!</h2> Welcome to my page <b>&</b> thanks for looking, I'm aware many of you had no choice in the matter as this is for class, but I appreciate it anyways. This webpage is dedicated to my precious little muppet-monster of a dog, <u>the one</u>, <b>the only</b>...<strong>ROSIE!!!</strong>
        <br><br>
        Though she's not here with me anymore, I miss her everyday <u>&</u> in the short years we had together she was my everything -- also I took a ridiculous amount of photos of her. Anyhoo, click around <strong>&</strong> enjoy!
